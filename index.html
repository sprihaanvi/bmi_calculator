      BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. <br />
      It is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared. <br />
      BMI is a useful tool for assessing a person's weight status and determining if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.<br> Generally, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered to be a healthy weight range, while a BMI above 25 is considered overweight and a BMI above 30 is considered obese.<br />

       However, BMI is only one indicator of health and should not be used as a standalone measure. Other factors such as body composition, muscle mass, and waist circumference should also be taken into account. Additionally, BMI may not be accurate for certain populations, such as athletes or the elderly.<br />
